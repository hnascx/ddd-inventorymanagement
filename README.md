# Inventory Management Service with DDD

This project applies Domain-Driven Design (DDD) focused on building an inventory management service. It includes comprehensive unit tests covering all the core routines typical of such a system.

The project is organized with a **core** layer containing entities and types, and a **domain** layer which includes entities, repositories, and use cases, following clean architecture principles.

### Testing
`npm run test`
